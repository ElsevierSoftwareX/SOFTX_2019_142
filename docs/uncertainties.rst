Error Propagation
=================

QExpy is designed to facilitate the propagation of errors from a measurement
(or set of measurement) to quantities that depend on that (those) measurement(s).
This section will describe how :py:class:`.Measurement`
objects are created and used in calculations.  Furthermore, features such
as the calculation of the exact numerical derivative of expressions will be
outlined.  While some aspects of this documentation will not necessarily be
required to work with the package itself, many of the methods used in the
underlying code can be useful to understand.

Creating Measurement Objects
----------------------------

The object that will be used most commonly is the :py:class:`.Measurement` class.  This
object can store the mean, standard deviation, original data, name, units,
and other attributes which can be used by other elements of this package.

.. autoclass:: qexpy.error.Measurement
   :noindex:

The arguments, or \*args, of this class can be entered in several forms:

A mean and standard deviation can be entered directly.

.. nbinput:: ipython3
   
   import qexpy as q
   x = q.Measurement(10, 1)
   # This would create an object with a mean of 10 and a standard
   # deviation of 1.

A list or numpy array of values can be provided, from which the mean and
standard deviation of the values is calculated.  These values can be
outputted by calling for the mean and std attributes of the object.

.. nbinput:: ipython3
   
   x = q.Measurement([9, 10, 11])
   # This would also produce an object with a mean of 10 and a standard
   # deviation of 1.  This can be shown by calling for x.mean and x.std:
	
   print(x.mean, x.std)
	
.. nboutput:: ipython3

   10, 1

If several measurements, each with an associated error needs to be entered,
a :py:func:`MeasurementArray` should be used. There are a few ways to create a :py:func:`MeasurementArray`:

For example, given measurements 10 +/- 1, 9 +/- 0.5 and 11 +/- 0.25, the
data can be entered as either:

.. nbinput:: ipython3
   
   x = q.MeasurementArray(data=[(10, 1), (9, 0.5), (11, 0.25)])
   y = q.MeasurementArray(data=[10, 9, 11], error=[1, 0.5, 0.25])
   # The mean and standard deviation of x and y are the same
   
If the error associated with each measured value is the same, a single
value can be entered into the second list in the *y* example shown above.
This is done simply for efficiency and is treated as a list of repeated
values.

.. nbinput:: ipython3

   x = q.MeasurementArray([9, 10, 11], 1)
   # This is equivalent to:
   y = q.MeasurementArray([9, 10, 11], [1, 1, 1])

A :py:func:`MeasurementArray` can also be created from an array of 
:py:class:`.Measurement` objects. If you have a group of :py:class:`Measurement` 
objects and want to group them together, this can be done by creating a 
:py:func:`MeasurementArray` containing them.

.. nbinput:: ipython3

   x = q.Measurement(9,1)
   y = q.Measurement(10,1)
   z = q.Measurement(11,1)

   arr = q.MeasurementArray([x, y, z])

In all cases, the optional arguments *name* and *units* can be used to
include strings for both of these parameters as shown below:

.. nbinput:: ipython3

   x = q.Measurement(10, 1, name='Length', units='cm')
   print(x)

.. nboutput:: ipython3

   Length = 10 +/- 1 [cm]

Working with Measurement Objects
--------------------------------

Once created, :py:class:`Measurement` objects can be operated on just as any other value:

.. nbinput:: ipython3
   
   import qexpy as q

   x = q.Measurement(10, 1)
   y = q.Measurement(3, 0.1)
   z = x-y

   print(z)

.. nboutput:: ipython3

   7 +/- 1

:py:class:`Measurement` objects can also be compared based on the value of their means:

.. nbinput:: ipython3

   import qexpy as q

   x = q.Measurement(10, 1)
   y = q.Measurement(3, 0.1)
   print(x>y)

.. nboutput:: ipython3

   True

Elementary functions such as the trig functions, inverse trig functions,
natural logarithm and exponential function can also be used:

.. nbinput:: ipython3

   f = q.sin(z)
   print(f)
	
.. nboutput:: ipython3

   0.7 +/- 0.8

Furthermore, the use of :py:class:`.Measurement` objects in equations also allows for the
calculation of the derivative of these expressions with respect to any of
the :py:class:`.Measurement` objects used.

.. nbinput:: ipython3

   d1 = f.get_derivative(x)

   # This can be compared to the analytic expression of the derivative
   d2 = m.cos(10-3)
   print(d1 == d2)

.. nboutput:: ipython3

   True

This derivative method is what is used to propagate error by the error
propagation formula.

.. math::
    
   For\ some\ F(x,y):
   \sigma_F^2 = (\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \sigma_x)^2 \
   + (\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \sigma_y)^2
    
This formula is the default method of error propagation and will be
accurate in most cases when the error is small.

Methods of Propagating Error
----------------------------

While the default method of propagating error is the derivative formula,
there are a number of other methods by which error can be calculated.
In addition to the derivative method, this package is also capable of
calculating error by the Monte Carlo and min-max methods.  While this
documentation will not go into detail about how these methods work, the
output of each method is available by default, and a specific method can be
chosen as shown below.

.. nbinput:: ipython3

   import qexpy as q
	
   x = q.Measurement(13,2)
   y = q.Measurement(2,0.23)
   z = x**2 - x/y
	
   print([z.mean, z.std])
   print(z.MC)
   print(z.MinMax)
	
.. nboutput:: ipython3

   [162.5, 51.00547770828149]
   [162.88454043577516, 51.509516186100562]
   [166.29634415140231, 53.770920422588731]

While the Monte Carlo and min-max output of the default method are not as
elegant as the derivative method, it does provide an easy avenue to check
the error against another method to ensure accuracy.

Furthermore, the output can be limited to a single method if desired.
In this case, the output seen in the *print(z)* line would be from whatever
method is chosen.

.. nbinput:: ipython3
	
   x = q.Measurement(10,2)
   y = q.Measurement(5,1)

   q.set_error_method("Derivative")
   # This option will limit the error calculation to using the derivative
   # formula

   z = x-y
   z.rename(name='Derivative Method')

   q.set_error_method("Monte Carlo")
   # This option will limit the error calculation to using the derivative
   # formula

   z = x-y
   z.rename(name='Monte Carlo')

   q.set_error_method("Min Max")
   # This option will limit the error calculation to using the derivative
   # formula

   z = x-y
   z.rename(name="Min Max")

Correlation
-----------

For many experiments, parameters may be correlated or may be expected to be
correlated.  Thus, there exists methods to define and, in the case that the
arrays of data used to create two :py:class:`Measurement` objects are equal
in length, return the covariance or correlation of some parameters. There are 
methods which can be used to set or get the correlation or covariance of two 
variables.

.. automethod:: qexpy.error.Measurement.set_covariance
   :noindex:

.. automethod:: qexpy.error.Measurement.get_covariance
   :noindex:

.. automethod:: qexpy.error.Measurement.set_correlation
   :noindex:

.. automethod:: qexpy.error.Measurement.get_correlation
   :noindex:

Furthermore, the covariance and correlation of the fitted parameters is found
automatically by the :py:meth:`.Plot.fit()` method. 


Derivatives
-----------

The method by which numerical solutions to the derivative of expressions
are evaluated is called automatic differentiation.  This method relies on
the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of any expression can be
reduced to some combination of elementary functions and operations.
Consider the following function.

.. math::

   f(x,y) &= \sin{xy} \\
   \implies \partial_x f(x,y) &= y\cos{xy} \quad \textrm{Let} \quad z=xy \\
   \partial_x f(x,y) &= \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \cos{z} = y\cos{xy}
   
What this example illustrates is how, by considering an expression as a
series of elementary operations and functions, the exact numerical
derivative can be calculated.  All that is required is to be able to store
the derivative of each of these elementary operations with respect to
whatever variables are involved.
